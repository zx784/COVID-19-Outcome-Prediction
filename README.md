## üéØ Project Overview

The primary goal of this study is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting whether a person is infected with COVID-19. The prediction is based on a set of 20 binary features that represent common symptoms, pre-existing health conditions, and exposure history. This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and comparison.

## üìä Dataset

The model was trained and evaluated on the **"COVID-19 Symptoms and Presence Dataset"** sourced from Kaggle.

- **Total Samples:** 5,434
- **Features:** 20 binary attributes (encoded as 1 for "Yes" and 0 for "No").
- **Target Variable:** `COVID-19` (1 for Positive, 0 for Negative).

### Features Summary
The features include a mix of symptoms, health history, and exposure factors:
- **Symptoms:** Fever, Dry Cough, Sore Throat, Breathing Problem, Headache, Fatigue, Running Nose, Gastrointestinal Issues.
- **Health History:** Asthma, Chronic Lung Disease, Heart Disease, Diabetes, Hypertension.
- **Exposure Factors:** Abroad Travel, Contact with COVID Patient, Attended Large Gathering, Visited Public Exposed Places, Family working in Public Exposed Places.
- **Precautionary Measures:** Wearing Masks, Sanitization from Market.

### Class Distribution
The original dataset exhibited a significant class imbalance, which was addressed during preprocessing:
- **Positive (1):** 4,250 samples (78.23%)
- **Negative (0):** 1,184 samples (21.77%)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

The project followed a structured machine learning pipeline:

1.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * **Label Encoding:** Converted categorical "Yes"/"No" values into binary 1/0.
    * **Train-Test Split:** The data was split into 80% for training and 20% for testing, using stratified sampling to maintain class proportions.
    * **Feature Scaling:** `StandardScaler` was applied to standardize the feature values, ensuring that all features contribute equally to model performance.

2.  **Handling Class Imbalance:**
    * **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique):** Applied to the training set to synthetically generate new samples for the minority class (Negative cases), creating a balanced dataset for model training.

3.  **Feature Selection:**
    * Several techniques were evaluated to identify the most impactful features and reduce dimensionality:
        * Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
        * Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
        * SelectKBest (ANOVA F-test)
        * Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
    * **PCA** was found to yield the best-performing models.

4.  **Model Selection and Training:**
    * Two powerful classifiers were chosen for this task:
        * **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Effective for high-dimensional spaces and non-linear problems.
        * **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A simple yet powerful instance-based learning algorithm.
    * Hyperparameter tuning was performed using `GridSearchCV` to find the optimal parameters for each model.

5.  **Evaluation:**
    * Models were evaluated on the unseen test set using a 10-fold cross-validation strategy.
    * The primary evaluation metrics were **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**, with a focus on the F1-Score due to its robustness in imbalanced scenarios.

## üìà Results

After comprehensive training and tuning, the models achieved high predictive accuracy. The **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier, when combined with **PCA** for feature selection, emerged as the top-performing model.

### Best Model Performance: KNN (with PCA)
| Metric    | Score   |
| :-------- | :------ |
| **Accuracy** | **98.25%** |
| **Precision** | **98.36%** |
| **Recall** | **98.25%** |
| **F1-Score** | **98.28%** |

These results indicate that the model is highly effective at correctly identifying both positive and negative COVID-19 cases from symptom data alone.

## üí° Key Insights

- Symptom-based prediction of COVID-19 using machine learning is a highly viable and effective approach for early screening.
- Proper data preprocessing, especially handling class imbalance with techniques like **SMOTE**, is crucial for building a reliable and unbiased model.
- Feature selection using **PCA** proved to be the most effective method for this dataset, improving model performance and efficiency.
- Both **SVM** and **KNN** are strong classifiers for this type of medical diagnostic task, with KNN showing a slight edge after tuning.

## üöÄ How to Run

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations and Future Work

- **Dataset:** The dataset is synthetic and may not perfectly reflect the complexities of real-world clinical data.
- **Future Work:**
    - Validate the model on a real-world, non-synthetic patient dataset.
    - Explore deep learning models (e.g., neural networks) to potentially capture more complex patterns.
    - Develop and deploy the final model as a web or mobile application for accessible public use.
